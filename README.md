## Vision 
### Canban.io was conceived with the intention to create a Kanban board that not only has all the features of the competitors, but also integrates your everday developer workflow into the mix. By include specific, one line, !canban syntax anywhere in your commit message, you are able to sync up with your github repository, and the corresponding card is auto-magically added to your kanban board for that specific workspace.

## Design
